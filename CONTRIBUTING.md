# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing!

A few rules of thumb:

- Code contributions should match the existing code style. Run `npm run lint` to check, and `npm run format` to fix some problems.
- Discuss additions/changes with us [on Discord](https://abal.moe/Eris/invite) before working on them
- Check the dev branch to make sure someone hasn't worked on the same thing already
- Pull requests should point to the dev branch, not master
